# Assignment 1

## Domains:
1. Helping with meal prepping: It costs a lot of money to eat out, so I like to cook meals when time allows. However, it is sometimes difficult to find recipes that match what I have in the fridge. If I knew what to make with such ingredients, it would help me from spending unnecessary money on eating out and keep variety in my home cooked meals.
2. Tracking how much/what categories someone spends on.
3. Filtering articles to read: There is only so much time in one day to do everything someone wants to do. I like to keep up with current events, but it takes a lot of time out of a day to even find relevant articles. There are also a lot of various sources and websites to get news from, which can be difficult to sort through. It would be helpful to have a consolidated list of articles that cater to my interests every day.
4. Scheduling gym/workout time based on commute, schedule, tiredness, etc.
5. Where to eat with a group of people.
6. Where to go on a walk/run.
7. Reminders to respond to emails/messages.
8. Tracking wait times for a restaurant/cafe: It has been getting harder and harder to eat at a restaurant without a reservation, especially ones that went "viral" online. It is hard to find a restaurant to go to in the first place, but to be turned away or faced with a long wait time is even more discouraging. It would be nice to have an app that shows the availability and waitlist of a restaurant without having to go in person. 
How long the current restaurant/cafe lines are without having to be there.
9. Tracking which friends borrowed what.
10. AR visualizing to see a furniture in living space.

## Problems:
### Domain 1
1. *(UNSELECTED)* Finding new recipes with accessible ingredients.
    - There are already many other ways to find new recipes, so this can be unnecessary for man people. 
2. *(UNSELECTED)* Using ingredients that are about to expire.
    - I personally have not had a problem failing to use them, but more of a failure in knowing they are about to expire.
3. *(SELECTED)* **Meal Prep Helper** - Prepping meals with ingredients someone already has.
    - I go grocery shopping and buy various ingredients that I like. Eventually, the combination of the ingredients that are left over are unusable together for a meal or require extra ingredients that I do not have. It would be nice to have a list of meals I could prep for the week with the groceries I have at home.
### Domain 3
1. *(UNSELECTED)* Lack of time to read all articles.
    - This is too general of a problem, so a more specific issue would be easier/more interesting to solve. Also, if this were the main issue to solve, the targeted audience may not be interested in reading articles at all.
2. *(SELECTED)* **News Filter** - Difficult to find articles of interest.
    - There are news sources that suggest articles for you to read, but I want something to consolidate various news sources. Article can be categorized for each person based on interest, bias, length, etc. This can not only save people's time but also recommend articles they may have otherwise missed.
3. *(UNSELECTED)* Identifying bias in news sources.
    - A lot of people tend to not care as much about biases and want to read whatever news source that tells them what they want to hear. It needs to be a broader problem.
### Domain 8
1. *(UNSELECTED)* Deciding on a restaurant to eat at.
    - Many applications already help with this, so it would not be innovative enough unless there was a specific problem to tackle.
2. *(UNSELECTED)* Finding a restaurant reservation.
    - Many applications already help with this in a variety of ways, like recommendations from friends, general public ratings, etc.
3. *(SELECTED)* **Wait Times** - Finding out wait times for restaurants.
    - Most restaurants won't give you a wait time online, but they also often are too busy to pick up phone calls. If there was a way to find out how long the wait would be before getting to the restaurant, it would help groups decide on their plan for the night. This can include how long they are willing to wait for a restaurant and whether there are other things to do in the area while waiting.

## Stakeholders:
- **Meal Prep Helper**: The primary stakeholder is people that like or prefer to cook at home but struggles with choosing what meal to cook. They would be able to reduce unused or mismatched groceries. Another stakeholder is grocery stores. If home cooks are smarter about buying their groceries, they might lose revenue. However, they could also benefit from loyal customers. Finally, those who live with home cooks will also benefit from an increase in variety in the meals and the a decrease waste.
  1. Home cooks: People that cook at home and want to avoid waste. 
  2. Grocery stores: Stores that may be impacted if people are smarter about their ingredient purchases.
  3. Home cooks' roommates: People that live with those that cook (friends, family, etc.).
- **News Filter**: The primary stakeholder is the people that like to keep up with the news but would prefer a more efficient system. The journalists or publishers are also impacted, as the algorithm would determine how visible their articles are. Fianlly, the advertisers' advertisements may or may not get more visibility from which articles are recommended. If people concentrate on a few articles per day, then there will be more competition to get an advertisement up on those articles.
  1. News readers: People that read the news regularly or would like to.
  2. Journalists/Publishers: People that are impacted by how much people read/click on an article.
  3. Advertisers: People whose job is to place advertisements in certain articles/news.
- **Wait Times**: The primary stakeholder is the people that eat at a restaurant, specifically without a reservation. With a reservation, there would not be a need for the wait times. The staff that work at busy restaurants can also save time from many phone calls or questions they get about the wait time or availability of the restaurant. The businesses nearby restaurants that can be used to kill time before dinner (bars, shopping, etc.) are also impacted depending on the lengths of the wait times.
  1. Restaurant customers: People that eat at a restaurant.
  2. Restaurant staff: People that work at a restaurant that may save time from answering inquiries about availability.
  3. Businesses nearby restaurants: Businesses that may be impacted while people wait for restaurant availability.

## Features:
### Meal Prep Helper
1. Ingredient Scanner
   - Users scan the grocery receipts to automatically log what ingredients they bought. This makes the process of tracking the food in the fridge easier for home cooks, and there will be less forgotten or mismatched ingredients.
2. Recipe Generator by Ingredients
   - Based on the logged ingredients, the app suggests recipes that use what’s already at home. It reduces the need for extra grocery runs and minimizes waste. This directly benefits home cooks by making meal choices easier, while their roommates or family get more variety at the dinner table.
3. Weekly Meal Plan Builder
   - Instead of suggesting single meals, the app creates a week’s worth of meals using the same base ingredients in different ways. This ensures balanced variety and prevents odd leftovers. It helps home cooks plan ahead and could encourage grocery stores to integrate with the app, to gain loyalty with customers if paired with store inventory.

### News Filter
1. Interest/Time Based Field
   - Articles are filtered not only by topic but also by estimated reading time (e.g., “5-min read before work”). This gives news readers an efficient way to keep up without feeling overwhelmed.
2. Multi-Source Consolidation
   - For a given news event, the app pulls articles from multiple outlets, then suggests the most relevant one to read. This helps news readers get the key perspective while also giving journalists and publishers fairer representation in visibility.
3. Bias/Perspective Indicator
   - Each article has a quick tag showing general bias (political, economic, etc.) or unique perspective. This lets news readers make more informed choices and allows advertisers to better align campaigns with readers’ interests and values.

### Wait Times
1. Live Crowd-Sourced Wait Estimates
   - Customers at restaurants can quickly log current wait times into the app, similar to how Waze crowdsources traffic. This reduces uncertainty for restaurant customers and saves restaurant staff from constant phone calls.
2. Live Restaurant-Provided Wait Estimates
   - Partner with restaurants to access their seating and queue data. The app shows how many tables are open, how many parties are ahead, and the estimated wait. This reduces uncertainty for restaurant customers and saves restaurant staff from answering repeated calls about availability.
3. Nearby Alternatives Suggestion
   - If the wait is long, the app suggests similar nearby restaurants or bars/shops to kill time. This helps businesses nearby benefit from extra foot traffic and gives restaurant customers a smoother overall experience.
