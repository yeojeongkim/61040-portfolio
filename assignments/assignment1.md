# Assignment 1

Domains:
1. It costs a lot of money to eat out, so I like to cook meals when time allows. However, it is sometimes difficult to find recipes that match what I have in the fridge. If I knew what to make with such ingredients, it would help me from spending unnecessary money on eating out and keep variety in my home cooked meals.
2. Tracking how much/what categories someone spends on.
3. There is only so much time in one day to do everything someone wants to do. I like to keep up with current events, but it takes a lot of time out of a day to even find relevant articles. There are also a lot of various sources and websites to get news from, which can be difficult to sort through. It would be helpful to have a consolidated list of articles that cater to my interests every day.
4. Scheduling gym/workout time based on commute, schedule, tiredness, etc.
5. Where to eat with a group of people.
6. Where to go on a walk/run.
7. Reminders to respond to emails/messages.
8. It has been getting harder and harder to eat at a restaurant without a reservation, especially ones that went "viral" online. It is hard to find a restaurant to go to in the first place, but to be turned away or faced with a long wait time is even more discouraging. It would be nice to have an app that shows the availability and waitlist of a restaurant without having to go in person. 
How long the current restaurant/cafe lines are without having to be there.
9. Tracking which friends borrowed what.
10. AR visualizing to see a furniture in living space.

Problems:
- Domain 1
  1. (UNSELECTED) Finding new recipes with accessible ingredients.
     - There are already many other ways to find new recipes (Google). 
  2. (UNSELECTED) Using ingredients that are about to expire.
     - I personally have not had a problem failing to use them, but more of a failure in knowing they are about to expire.
  3. (SELECTED) **Meal Prep Helper** - Prepping meals with ingredients someone already has.
     - I go grocery shopping and buy various ingredients that I like. Eventually, the combination of the ingredients that are left over are unusable together for a meal or require extra ingredients that I do not have. It would be nice to have a list of meals I could prep for the week with the groceries I have at home.
- Domain 3
  1. (UNSELECTED) Lack of time to read all articles.
     - This is too general of a problem, so a more specific issue would be easier/more interesting to solve.
  2. (SELECTED) **News Filter** - Difficult to find articles of interest.
     - There are news sources that suggest articles for you to read, but I want something to consolidate various news sources. I want the algorithm to help identify which article is the best for someone to read based on interest, bias, length, etc.
  3. (UNSELECTED) Identifying bias in news sources.
     - A lot of people tend to not care as much about biases.
- Domain 8
  1. (UNSELECTED) Deciding on a restaurant to eat at.
     - Many applications already help with this (Google, Yelp, etc.).
  2. (UNSELECTED) Finding a restaurant reservation.
     - Many applications already help with this (Resy, Opentable, etc).
  3. (SELECTED) **Wait Times** Finding out wait times for restaurants.
     - Most restaurants won't give you a wait time online, but they also often are too busy to pick up phone calls. If there was a way to find out how long the wait would be before getting to the restaurant, it would help groups decide on their plan for the night. This can include how long they are willing to wait for a restaurant and whether there are other things to do in the area while waiting.

Stakeholders:
- Meal Prep Helper: The primary stakeholder is people that like or prefer to cook at home but struggles with choosing what meal to cook. They would be able to reduce unused or mismatched groceries. Another stakeholder is grocery stores. If home cooks are smarter about buying their groceries, they might lose revenue. However, they could also benefit from loyal customers. Finally, those who live with home cooks will also benefit from an increase in variety in the meals and the a decrease waste.
  1. Home cooks: People that cook at home and want to avoid waste. 
  2. Grocery stores: Stores that may be impacted if people are smarter about their ingredient purchases.
  3. Home cooks' roommates: People that live with those that cook (friends, family, etc.).
- News Filter: The primary stakeholder is the people that like to keep up with the news but would prefer a more efficient system. The journalists or publishers are also impacted, as the algorithm would determine how visible their articles are. Fianlly, the advertisers' advertisements may or may not get more visibility from which articles are recommended. If people concentrate on a few articles per day, then there will be more competition to get an advertisement up on those articles.
  1. News readers: People that read the news regularly or would like to.
  2. Journalists/Publishers: People that are impacted by how much people read/click on an article.
  3. Advertisers: People whose job is to place advertisements in certain articles/news.
- Wait Times: The primary stakeholder is the people that eat at a restaurant, specifically without a reservation. With a reservation, there would not be a need for the wait times. The staff that work at busy restaurants can also save time from many phone calls or questions they get about the wait time or availability of the restaurant. The businesses nearby restaurants that can be used to kill time before dinner (bars, shopping, etc.) are also impacted depending on the lengths of the wait times.
  1. Restaurant customers: People that eat at a restaurant.
  2. Restaurant staff: People that work at a restaurant that may save time from answering inquiries about availability.
  3. Businesses nearby restaurants: Businesses that may be impacted while people wait for restaurant availability.
