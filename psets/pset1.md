# Problem Set 1

## Exercise 1: Reading a concept
1. **Invariants**. What are two invariants of the state? (Hint: one is about aggregation/counts of items, and one relates requests and purchases). Say which one is more important and why; identify the action whose design is most affected by it, and say how it preserves it.
   - An invariant of the state is that the count cannot be negative, as in an item cannot be purchased more than the count recorded in the registry. The action *purchase* is most affected by it, as it requires that the registry "has a request for this item with at least count". This preserves the invariant by preventing a purchase that attempts to buy more than the count. Another invariant is that an item has to have a request (i.e. exist in the registry) for it to be purchased. The action *purchase* is again the most impacted because it requires that the request for this item exists in an active registry. This preserves the invariant by preventing purchases for items that were not added to the registry. The second invariant is more important because it prevents the owner of the registry from receiving random gifts that they did not want. It could cause none of the registered items being purchased, which defeats the purpose of a gift registry. If the first invariant were to be broken, then the owner may simply receive duplicates of a gift they wanted. 

2. **Fixing an action**. Can you identify an action that potentially breaks this important invariant, and say how this might happen? How might this problem be fixed?
   - The action *removeItem* can break the invariant. If an item was added to the registry, then someone can make a purchase for the item. However, the invariant breaks if this item were to be removed because there would be a purchase for an item that no longer has a request. This can be fixed by prohibiting a removal if an item exists in the purchase history and allowing the owner to decrease the count to match the number of purchases in case the owner decides they do not want more of the item. 

3. **Inferring behavior**. The operational principle describes the typical scenario in which the registry is opened and eventually closed. But a concept specification often allows other scenarios. By reading the specs of the concept actions, say whether a registry can be opened and closed repeatedly. What is a reason to allow this?
   - A reason to allow this is to prepare for an accidental opening or closing of a registry. If the user prematurely opens or closes a registry, then there should be an option to open/close again to fix the mistake, then still able to open/close at a later time. 

4. **Registry deletion**. There is no action to delete a registry. Would this matter in practice?
   - This would matter based on the design of the website, and in some extreme cases. If the website does not separate open and closed registries, then some users that frequently use gift registries would want to keep everything organized by deleting old registries. In other extreme cases, the owner of the registry may have bad memories associated to one and wish to delete it completely.

5. **Queries**. What are two common queries likely to be executed against the concept state? (Hint: one is executed by a registry owner, and one by a giver of a gift.)
   - One common query likely to be executed against the concept state is to track what has been purchased. Another common query is for the givers of a gift to see what items have not been purchased yet.

6. **Hiding purchases**. A common feature of gift registries is to allow the recipient to choose not to see purchases so that an element of surprise is retained. How would you augment the concept specification to support this?
   - First, I would edit the state of Registrys to become:
      - a set of Registrys with
         - an owner User
         - an active Flag
         - a showPurchases Flag
         - a set of Requests
   - This flag can be edited by adding one action:
      - togglePurchaseVisibility (registry: Registry, flag: Boolean)
         - **requires** registry exists
         - **effects** allow the user to see purchases if flag is True, otherwise hide purchases

7. **Generic types**. The User and Item types are specified as generic parameters. The Item type might be populated by SKU codes, for example. Explain why this is preferable to representing items with their names, descriptions, prices, etc.
   - SKU codes are preferable because they are guaranteed to be unique, whereas some items may be listed with the same or similar name, description, and price. To add on, the codes do not fluctuate unlike the other representations that could change over time. This consistency ensures that each item is the desired or purchased item, even if the other data changes.


## Exercise 2: Extending a familiar concept
1. Complete the definition of the concept state.
   - ans

2. Write a requires/effects specification for each of the two actions. (Hints: The register action creates and returns a new user. The authenticate action is primarily a guard, and doesnâ€™t mutate the state.)
   - ans

3. What essential invariant must hold on the state? How is it preserved?
   - ans

4. One widely used extension of this concept requires that registration be confirmed by email. Extend the concept to include this functionality. (Hints: you should add (1) an extra result variable to the register action that returns a secret token that (via a sync) will be emailed to the user; (2) a new confirm action that takes a username and a secret token and completes the registration; (3) whatever additional state is needed to support this behavior.)
   - ans
